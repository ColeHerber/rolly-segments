MQTT BROKER NOTES ------------------------------------------------------

Making a mac machine as a broker
mosquitto
  brew install mosquitto

    Make start on boot
        brew services start mosquitto #autostarts forever until stopped
    To make stop 
        brew services stop mosquitto
    to restart
    
Edited the mosquitto.conf file because of wsl2
    code /opt/homebrew/etc/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf     
    # In order to make this work with more than just WSL2:
    listener 1883 0.0.0.0
    # Also I added each user on ~line 584
    user snap
    user crackle
    user pop

Added a user to the mosquitto broker(do it twice?)
    mosquitto_passwd -c /opt/homebrew/etc/mosquitto/passwd <username>
    # Enter password:
    # replace -c with -b if you are adding a user to an existing file

(remember to restart mosquitto when editing .conf file)
   brew services restart mosquitto
